# nanoBragg

program for calculation of absolute scattering from molecules and small crystals

This short program calculates the absolute-scale scattering from a nanocrystal
that is "bathed" in a beam of a given integrated photon density 
(specified in photons/meter<sup>2</sup>). For example, 10<sup>12</sup> photons
focused into a 3-micron round beam is represented by "-fluence 1.4e24". Images 
of the expected photons/pixel on the detector, with and without photon-counting
noise are generated in SMV format (suitable for display with [ADXV][adxv],
[MOSFLM][mosflm], or most any other diffraction image display program).

The structure factor of the spots should be provided on an absolute "electron" scale
(as output by programs like [phenix.fmodel][fmodel], [REFMAC][refmac], or [SFALL][sfall]),
but must be converted to a plain text file of h,k,l,F.  Note that no symmetry is imposed by this
program, not even Friedel symmetry, so all reflections you wish to be non-zero intensity must be
specified, including F000. The unit cell and crystal orientation may be provided as a 
[MOSFLM][mosflm]-style orientation matrix, which is again a text file and the first nine tokens read
from it are taken as the x,y,z components of the three reciprocal-space cell vectors 
(a,b,c are the columns, x,y,z are the rows). 

The program also contains an option for adding approximate scattering from the water droplet
presumed to be surrounding the nanocrystal.  The diameter of this droplet in microns is provided
with the "-water" option, and assumes a forward-scattering structure factor of 2.57 electrons.
The default value for this option is zero.

This repository contains two implementations: the classic **C** program ([nanoBragg.c](nanoBragg.c)), documented in the **C reference implementation** section below, and a **PyTorch** reimplementation with a compatible CLI and automatic differentiation. For conda envs, install steps, and GPU PyTorch wheels, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Usage, tests, and troubleshooting for the Python package are under **PyTorch implementation** below; a longer design-oriented guide lives in [docs/pytorch_guide.md](docs/pytorch_guide.md).

## C reference implementation

## source

source code: [nanoBragg.c](nanoBragg.c) (49k).

## compile

```
gcc -O -O -o nanoBragg nanoBragg.c -lm -static
```

For reproducible **conda** compiler environments, the **CUDA** build under [`cuda/`](cuda/), and **PyTorch** packaging, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## useful auxillary programs

[UBtoA.awk](UBtoA.awk) can be used to generate a MOSFLM -style orientation matrix, and

[mtz_to_P1hkl.com](mtz_to_P1hkl.com) is a script for converting mtz-formatted structure factors into
a format that nanoBragg can read.

[noisify][noisify] is a program that takes the "photons/pixel" noiseless intensity values output by `nonBragg`, `nanoBragg`, or `nearBragg` as "floagimage.bin" and adds different kinds of noise to it
to generate an SMV file.  This is usually faster than re-running `nonBragg` just to change things
like beam intensity.  In addition to photon shot noise, noisify has a few kinds of noise that
`nonBragg` doesn't implement, such as pixel read-out noise, beam flicker, and calibration error.

[float_add][float_add] may be used to add the raw "float" binary files output by `nonBragg`,
`nanoBragg`, or even `nearBragg` so that renderings may be divided up on separate CPUs and then
combined together.  The resulting raw files may then be converted to SMV images with `noisify`.

[float_func][float_func] can perform a large number of operations on these "floagimage.bin" files.

[nonBragg](nonBragg.c) is for generating scattering from amorphous substances, like water and air. You will
need to feed it a text file containing the "structure factor" of the amorphous material vs
sin(theta)/lambda. A few examples are:

[air.stol](air.stol)

[He.stol](He.stol)

[ice.stol](ice.stol)

[nanoice.stol](nanoice.stol)

[Paratone-N.stol](Paratone-N.stol)

[water.stol](water.stol)

## example usage:

get some structure factor data

```
getcif.com 3pcq
```

refine to get **F**s on an absolute scale

```
refmac5 hklin 3pcq.mtz xyzin 3pcq.pdb hklout refmacout.mtz xyzout refmacout.pdb << EOF | tee refmac.log
REFI TYPE RIGID
TWIN
EOF
```

extract the (de-twinned) calculated Fs, which are always 100% complete:

```
mtz_to_P1hkl.com refmacout.mtz FC_ALL_LS
```

make a random orientation matrix:

```
./UBtoA.awk << EOF | tee A.mat
CELL 281 281 165.2 90 90 120 
WAVE 6.2
RANDOM
EOF
```

run the simulation of a 10x10x10 unit cell crystal

```
./nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -matrix A.mat -lambda 6.2 -N 10
```

view the result

```
adxv intimage.img
```

convert and re-scale as regular graphics file

```
convert -depth 16 -type Grayscale -colorspace GRAY -endian LSB -size 1024x1024+512 -negate \ 
-normalize GRAY:intimage.img
```
![some alternate description here](doc/intimage_10cells_tmb.png)

Note the "low resolution hole", which is due to the missing low-angle data in the PDB deposition.
Missing high-resolution spots that would otherwise fall on the detector will generate a WARNING
message in the program output and potentially undefined spot intensities, so make sure you "fill" 
the resolution of interest in the P1.hkl file.

Note also that this image is very clear, with lots of inter-Bragg spot subsidiary peaks.
That is because it is a noiseless simulation.

Now have a look at the "noiseimage.img" which is scaled so that one pixel 
unit is one photon:

```
adxv noiseimage.img
```

It has been re-scaled here as a png for better viewing:

![](doc/noiseimage_10cells_tmb.png)

Still not bad, but this is because there is no background, and the default fluence is 1e24,
 or 10<sup>12</sup> photons focused into a 1 micron beam.

Now lets do something more realistic. The fluence of a 10<sup>12</sup>-photon pulse focused into
a 7 micron beam is 2e22 photons/m<sup>2</sup>.  Also, the liquid jet used by 
[Chapman et al (2010)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7332/full/nature09750.html)
was four microns wide:

```
./nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -matrix A.mat -lambda 6.2 -N 10 -fluence 2e22 -water 4
```

visualize results:

```
adxv noiseimage.img
```

![](doc/noiseimage_10cells_water_tmb.png)


If you look closely, you can see the spots.  Note that this is an idealized case where only
photon-counting noise is present. There is no detector read-out noise, no point-spread function,
no amplifier drift, no pixel saturation and no calibration errors.  Many of these errors
can be added using [noisify][noisify], but not all. Watch this space for updates.

# SAXS simulations

`nanoBragg` can also be used to simulate small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns by
simply setting the number of unit cells to one (-N 1 on the command line).
Tricubic interpolation between the hkl indicies will be used to determine the intensity
between the "spots".

## example usage:

get lysozyme

```
getcif.com 193l
```

refine to get the solvent parameters

```
phenix.refine 193l.pdb 193l.mtz | tee phenix_refine.log
```

Now put these atoms into a very big unit cell. It is important that this cell be
at least 3-4 times bigger than your molecule in all directions.  Otherwise, you will
get neigbor-interference effects.  Most people don't want that in their SAXS patterns.

```
pdbset xyzin 193l.pdb xyzout bigcell.pdb << EOF
CELL 250 250 250 90 90 90
SPACEGROUP 1
EOF
```

calculate structure factors of the molecule isolated in a huge "bath" of the
best-fit solvent.

```
phenix.fmodel bigcell.pdb high_resolution=10 \
 k_sol=0.35 b_sol=46.5 mask.solvent_radius=0.5 mask.shrink_truncation_radius=0.16
```

note that this procedure will fill the large cell with a solvent of average
electron density 0.35 electrons/A^3. The old crystallographic contacts
will be replaced with the same solvent boundary model that fit the solvent
channels in the crystal structure.

now we need to convert these Fs into a format nanoBragg can read

```
mtz_to_P1hkl.com bigcell.pdb.mtz
```

and create a random orientation matrix

```
./UBtoA.awk << EOF | tee bigcell.mat
CELL 250 250 250 90 90 90 
WAVE 1
RANDOM
EOF
```

and now, make the diffraction image

```
./nanoBragg -mat bigcell.mat -hkl P1.hkl -lambda 1 -dispersion 0 \
  -distance 1000 -detsize 100 -pixel 0.1 \
  -hdiv 0 -vdiv 0 \
  -fluence 1e32 -N 1
```

visualize the results:

```
adxv noiseimage.img
```

![](doc/noiseimage_SAXS_tmb.png)

Notice that the center of the image is white. This is not a beamstop! What is
actually going on is that F000 is missing in P1.hkl, and so is being replaced with
zero intensity.  You can fix this by adding an F000 term:

```
echo "0 0 0 520" >> P1.hkl
./nanoBragg -mat bigcell.mat -hkl P1.hkl -lambda 1 -dispersion 0 \
  -distance 1000 -detsize 100 -pixel 0.1 \
  -hdiv 0 -vdiv 0 \
  -fluence 1e32 -N 1
```

then visualize:

```
adxv noiseimage.img
```

![](doc/noiseimage_SAXS_F000_tmb.png)

You might wonder, however, why the **F000** term is ~500 and not the number of electrons
in lysozyme, which is ~8000. The reason here is the bulk solvent. The volume of
water displaced by the lysozyme molecule contains almost as many electrons as the
lysozyme molecule itself. Protein, however, is slightly denser, and so there are
an extra ~520 electrons "peeking" above the average density of the solvent.

Of course, most real SAXS patterns are centrosymmetric because they are an average
over trillions of molecules in solution, each in a random orientation.  The SAXS 
pattern generated here is for a single molecule exposed to 1e34 photons/m<sup>2</sup>, 
but this is equivalent to 1e18 photons focused onto an area
barely larger than the molecule!  However, 1e12 photons focused onto a 100x100
micron area (1e20 phm<sup>2</sup>) containing 1e14 molecules will generate a pattern 
of similar intensity level, albeit rotationally averaged.

One way to simulate such images would be to use this program to generate a few
thousand or million orientations and then average the results.  This could be instructive
for exploring fluctuation SAXS. However, a much faster way would
be to pre-average the squared structure factors to form a new P1.hkl file, and then
generate one image with a "-fluence" equal to the actual fluence, multiplied by the
number of exposed molecules.  A convenient script for doing this is:

```
mtz_to_stol.com bigcell.pdb.mtz
```

which will create a file called [mtz.stol](mtz.stol) that you can feed to nonBragg:

```
./nonBragg -stol mtz.stol -lambda 1 -dispersion 0 \
  -distance 1000 -detsize 100 -pixel 0.1 \
  -hdiv 0 -vdiv 0 \
  -flux 1e13 -thick 1.2 -MW 14000 -density 0.01
```

then visualize the results:

```
adxv noiseimage.img
```

![](doc/noiseimage_SAXS_radial_tmb.png)

Which starts to look more like a SAXS pattern from a conventional SAXS beamline.  Note that
the "density" of the sample in this case is 0.01 g/cm^3 or 10 mg/mL.

## PyTorch implementation

The PyTorch port (`import nanobrag_torch`) provides a **drop-in CLI** (`nanoBragg` or `python -m nanobrag_torch`) aligned with the C program, plus **differentiable** simulation for optimization and inverse problems. Conceptual notes (vectorization vs C loops, autograd, gradcheck) are in [docs/pytorch_guide.md](docs/pytorch_guide.md).

### Install

Create the **`nanobragg_torch`** conda environment, install a **PyTorch** build (CPU or CUDA matching your driver), then install this repo in editable mode. Full commands: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) § *PyTorch (`nanobragg_torch` conda environment)*.

```bash
export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE   # recommended; avoids MKL/OpenMP clashes with PyTorch
pip install -e .                   # from repository root, env activated
```

### Basic CLI

```bash
nanoBragg -h
# or
python -m nanobrag_torch -h
```

Minimal example (cell parameters, uniform structure factor):

```bash
python -m nanobrag_torch -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 \
  -default_F 100 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 256 -floatfile output.bin
```

More examples (cubic, triclinic, HKL files, conventions) are in [docs/pytorch_guide.md](docs/pytorch_guide.md#common-examples).

### Tests

Set at least **`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`** before `pytest`.

**Session infrastructure gate** ([`tests/conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py)): at the start of a test session, pytest checks for a usable **C `nanoBragg` binary** (`NB_C_BIN`, or `./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`, or `./nanoBragg`), **`scaled.hkl`** at the repo root, and **`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json`**. If any check fails, the session aborts unless you bypass the gate:

```bash
export NB_SKIP_INFRA_GATE=1   # local/dev only; skips CI-style infrastructure checks
```

**C↔PyTorch comparison tests** often require:

```bash
export NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1
# optional explicit C binary:
# export NB_C_BIN=/path/to/nanoBragg
```

**Slurm / GPU cluster:** to run the parity matrix on an allocated GPU node without GitHub Actions, see [`scripts/cluster/run_parity_matrix.sh`](scripts/cluster/run_parity_matrix.sh) and the **Cluster / Slurm** subsection in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
# faster iteration:
pytest tests/ -m "not slow" -v --tb=line
# by area:
pytest tests/test_at_parallel_*.py -v
pytest tests/test_at_geo_*.py -v
pytest tests/test_gradients.py -v
```

**Key groups:** AT-PARALLEL (C vs PyTorch equivalence), AT-GEO (geometry), AT-STR / AT-IO (structure factors and I/O), gradient tests in `tests/test_gradients.py`.

### Troubleshooting (PyTorch)

- **MKL / OpenMP:** `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
- **C binary not found:** `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` or build `make -C golden_suite_generator` (see C section above).
